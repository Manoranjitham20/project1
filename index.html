<p> MYSQL

     MySQL is a popular database management system. It has a free and open source version. With its rich features, it has been the choice for many database driven PHP applications.
MySQL  History

    <p> MySQL was founded by Michael Widenius and David Axmark  in 1994. It was then developed under the company MySQL AB where the company provided both open source and commercial licenses. In January 2008, Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB and in January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems making MySQL owned by Oracle.Since Oracle is primarily a proprietary software company, concerns have been raised about the future of MySQL. MySQL forks like MariaDB and alternatives like PostgreSQL have gained more attention with these concerns. However still MySQL is used by many open source software and large scale websites.</p>
<p>
<p> Why to Use?
     Oracle greatly supports RDBMS features. Also it supports high security to the data and faster accessing capability. It can be run on a variety of platforms and operating systems. One can develop an application easily by providing user-friendly environment.
The features of oracle are portability and compatibility.

	JavaScript Examples
		The JavaScript example is the easiest to code. The reason being there are three places where the code can be placed
				Here are the three places where the JavaScript can be saved.
					One is within the existing body tag, it can be saved in the head tag and last but not the least it can be saved in the external JavaScript file.
</pre>
<p>
The script tag present in the JavaScript file mentions that we are using the JavaScript.
Next the text or the actual script used this is the content which will provide information to the browser for the data. The document.Write() is the function which is used in order to display the dynamic content using the JavaScript.
There are three main places where the JavaScript code can be embedded are mentioned below:
o	Between the tag of the body of the text
o	Between the head tag
o	In the .js file
